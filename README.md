# Machine-Learning-model-for-Eye-State-Estimation

•	Pre-processing was conducted, missing values were analyzed and eliminated, scaling was performed to standardize the inputs

•	Unsupervised ML was applied to understand the nature of the response variable and Hyper-parameter tuning was applied to evaluate the best parameters

•	Scikit-learn was utilized to develop and initiate the model, and predictions were recovered & stored as a CSV
